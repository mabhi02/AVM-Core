# AVM-CORE

**A**daptive **V**alidation **M**odel with **CO**mpositional **RE**asoning

## 🔍 Overview

AVM-CORE is a state-of-the-art system that advances mathematical reasoning through compositional neural architectures. By combining transformer-based models with graph neural networks, it provides a novel approach to understanding, validating, and generating mathematical proofs.

## 🌟 Core Capabilities

- **Compositional Reasoning**: Decomposes complex mathematical proofs into fundamental components
- **Strategy Synthesis**: Dynamically combines multiple proof strategies
- **Graph-Based Understanding**: Models mathematical concepts as interconnected knowledge graphs
- **Hierarchical Validation**: Ensures correctness at both local and global levels

## 🏗️ Architecture

AVM-CORE consists of three primary components:

1. **Adaptive Layer**
   - Dynamic strategy selection
   - Multi-head attention for concept relationships
   - Proof path optimization

2. **Compositional Engine**
   - Graph neural networks for concept representation
   - Transformer-based reasoning modules
   - Hierarchical proof construction

3. **Validation Framework**
   - Step-by-step verification
   - Logical consistency checking
   - Proof completeness assessment

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AVM-CORE.git
cd AVM-CORE

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Usage

```python
from avm.core import AVMCore
from avm.core.strategies import ProofStrategy

# Initialize model
model = AVMCore(
    hidden_dim=256,
    num_layers=6,
    strategy_types=["direct", "induction", "contradiction"]
)

# Generate and validate a proof
theorem = "Prove that the sum of the first n positive integers is n(n+1)/2"
proof = model.generate_proof(theorem)

# Display proof with validation scores
for step in proof.steps:
    print(f"Step: {step.text}")
    print(f"Validation Score: {step.validation_score:.2f}")
    print(f"Strategy Used: {step.strategy_type}")
```
